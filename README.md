# base64
Convert, compress and share text in base64 format, for web, mobile, and web applications. A JavaScript library for moving data around in a compact and compatible format. Includes a few handy helper functions.

## Basic usage involves:
```javascript
var str = "my string of text";
var data = Base64.write(str);
//do something cool with data like saving it to localStorage or as a cookie
var str2 = Base64.read(data);
```

## Handy helper functions:
`Base64.share` Share plaintext as a JSON object with someone if you know their public key (as generated by base64.js)

`Base64.readShared` Read a shared JSON object

`Base64.write_and_verify` Same as Base64.write, but does some error checking as well

`Base64.hash` Salted SHA256 hash

`Base64.number_hash` Converts any string to a positive integer of the requiredLength

`Base64.rand` Generate a random number up to 300 digits long

`Base64.createPublicKey` Creates a Diffie Hellman Merkle public key from any string (usually from a secret password)

`Base64.getSessionKey` Creates a Diffie Hellman Merkle session key from your own secret private key and someone elses public key

`Base64.createUserKey` Create a secondary secret key to share with someone if you know their public key.

`Base64.createUserKey_and_verify` Same as Base64.createUserKey, but needs the user's private key to verify

`Base64.readUserKey` Read a secret key (userKey) that was shared with you, using your own secret key and the person who shared it with you's public key

## Sharing (is caring)
`Base64.share` accepts 4 parameters: `str`, `myPrivateKey`, `theirPublicKeys`, and `expires`. It returns a JSON Object that can be shared with another individual.
### parameters
`str` is any text of type String that you would like to share with another individual.

`myPrivateKey` can be anything you want it to be. Length not limited.

`theirPublicKeys` accepts an Array of `publicKeys`. `publicKeys` must be generated by calling `Base64.createPublicKey`, which accepts one parameter, a `privateKey`... which you likely don't know. Try asking really nice, or just arrange for a way to get `theirPublicKeys`.

`expires` accepts a Number in months until data is no longer valid (optional, can be easily bypassed if source code is known).

## Reading a shared JSON Object
`Base64.readShared` accepts 2 parameters: `obj` and `myPrivateKey`. It returns a JSON Object as well.
### parameters
`obj` is the JSON Object created by `Base64.share`.

`myPrivateKey` is one of the private keys corresponding to a public key used in generating the JSON Object (see `theirPublicKeys` above).

# Disclaimer
By now you've probably noticed quite a bit about public and private keys, and sharing data, but nothing about encryption! That's because any "encryption" algorythm included in this package is haphazard at best and **should not be trusted for any kind of sensitive data**.
